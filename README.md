## Name
TetrisJet

## Description
This project involves making a compiler, and a Tetris program that runs on the compiler. 

## Badges
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Contributing
We are open for contributions.

See demo video for more information on the project.
